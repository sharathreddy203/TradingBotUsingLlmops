Cimetrix \\nCIMConnect, Cimetrix CIM300, and Cimetrix CIMPortal Plus are in tegrated with Cimetrix CCF to support the \\nSEMI GEM, GEM300, and E DA/Interface A standards.  \\nServices \\nOur services are almost always s old together with, or to suppor t, our products and include the following: \\nSoftware-as-a-Service –  We provide services to make our  Exensio software available to our customers via the Internet, \\ngenerally hosted by third-party providers. SaaS is considered p art of cloud computing since the software is hosted on the \\nInternet, or the “cloud.” Since  our SaaS applications are acces sed from a remote server rather than installed on individual \\nmachines, it is easier to maintain. For example, when the remot e software is updated, the customer’s interface is also \\nupdated for all users. Cloud computing is designed to eliminate  incompatibilities between differ ent software versions and \\nallow us to make incremental updates without requiring software  downloads. Additionally, our customers can save data to \\na central online location, which is designed to allow increased  project collaboration. As part of these services, we also \\ntypically provide hosted management services for the software a nd the customer’s data stored in our cloud. These services \\ninclude environment set-up and configuration, system health mon itoring, data integration maintenance, integration \\nmonitoring, system updates, security, and data upload/download,  and license administration. \\nSoftware Related Services  – We provide software maintenance and support (“M&S”), data ma nagement services, \\nvarious value-added services (“VAS”) to install, configure, or create analysis templates, and other professional services to \\nachieve customers’ specific outcomes using our software. We cal l this last type of services our solutions offering and, in \\nthese cases, we tailor the use of  one or more Exensio products to achieve a desired result. For example, our AIM \\nYieldAware™ FDC solution offering is designed to identify the p rocess control variables that have the greatest impact on \\nproduct yield through professional services that analyze the da ta from both Exensio Proce ss Control and elements of \\nExensio Manufacturing Analytics and make recommendations for th e customer to implement. VAS are provided by our \\nprofessional service personnel w ith expertise that enhances and  complements the engineering teams at our customers. For \\nexample, VAS includes our data cleaning and monitoring services . One requirement of big data analytics is to have clean, \\nharmonized data to analyze. This service offering outsources th e data wrangling and management effort to free the \\ncustomer to focus their efforts on analysis, which has a greate r ROI to the company than data management. \\nCharacterization Services  – These services are designed to characterize key product and/ or process elements, \\nprimarily into CV test structures  or DFI on-chip measurement in struments, and typically do not include performance ' metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Complete_Content\\\\GENERATIVEAI\\\\llmopstradingbot\\\\data\\\\finance_data.pdf', 'page': 11}\n",

We provid e these services, typically together with all elements of \\nour CV system, to foundry customers in connection with new proc ess technology development and/or yield ramp. In \\nCharacterization engagements, we generally provide the analysis  of our CV test chips and provide summary findings and \\nrecommendations to the customer. Characterization engagements c an include DFI systems. \\nCustomers \\nOur existing customers include f oundries, IDMs, fabless semicon ductor design companies, OSATs, equipment \\nmanufacturers, EMS, and ODMs, including those that embed and di stribute our Assembly Operations modules in their \\nequipment. Our semiconductor customers’ targeted product segmen ts vary significantly, including microprocessors, \\nmemory, graphics, image sensor solutions, and communications. W e believe that the adoption of our solutions by such \\ncompanies for usage in a wide range of products validates the a pplication of our solutions to the broader semiconductor \\nmarket. We often have multiple contracts with a single customer  or customer group, with no in terdependent performance \\nobligations. In general, our customer contracts are non-cancell able. \\nOne customer accounted for 35% of  our revenues for 2023, two cu stomers accounted for 41% of our revenues for \\n2022 and two customers accounted for 27% of our revenues for 20 21. No other customers accounted for 10% or more of \\nour revenues in 2023, 2022 and 2021. Also, two customers accoun ted for 50% of our gross accounts receivable as of \\nDecember 31, 2023, and three cust omers accounted for 53% of our  gross accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022. \\nWe generally do not require collateral or other security to sup port accounts receivable. See the discussion in “Risk Factors” \\nunder Item 1A for more information about risks associated with customer concentration and contractual provisions. \\nInternational revenues accounted for approximately 44%, 50% and  55% of our total revenues for 2023, 2022 and \\n2021, respectively. We base these calculations on the geographi c location of where the work is performed or where the \\ncustomer is located. Revenues from customers by geographic area  based on the location of the customers’ work sites for \\nthe last three fiscal years can be  found in Note 11, “Customer and Geographic Information” to the consolidated financial \\nstatements. Additional discussion  regarding the risks associate d with international operations can be found under Item 1A, \\n“Risk Factors”. \\nSee our “Notes to Consolidated F inancial Statements”, included under Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and \\nSupplementary Data” for additional geographic information. \\nSales and Marketing \\nOur sales strategy is primarily  to pursue targeted accounts thr ough a combination of our direct sales force, our service \\nteams, and strategic alliances. After we are engaged by a custo mer and early in the services p rocess, our engineers seek to \\nestablish relationships in the organization and gain an underst anding of our customers’ business issues. Our direct sales \\nand service teams combine their efforts to deepen our customer relationships by expanding our penetration across \\ncustomers’ products, processes, and technologies. This close wo rking relationship with each customer has the added \\nbenefit of helping us to identify new product areas and technol ogies in which we should next focus our research and \\ndevelopment efforts. From time-to -time, we use sales representa tives/agents in various locations to augment direct sales \\nin certain territories.  \\nWe expect to continue to establish strategic alliances with pro cess licensors, vendors in the electronic design \\nautomation software, capital equipment for IC production, and t est silicon IP and mask-making s oftware segmen ts to create \\nand take advantage of sales channel and co-marketing opportunit ies. Additionally, we expect to form relationships with \\nkey value chain participants, including foundries and OSATs, to  provide services and value across the manufacturing \\nsupply chain. \\nResearch and Development \\nOur research and development focuses on developing and introduc ing new proprietary technologies for our \\ncomprehensive platform, including our Exensio software, Cimetri x connectivity and control products, and DFI and CV \\nsystems, as well as other software products and enhancements to  our existing solutions, such as field applications for DFI ' metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Complete_Content\\\\GENERATIVEAI\\\\llmopstradingbot\\\\data\\\\finance_data.pdf', 'page': 12}\n",
      "3 page_content='Table of Contents \\n12 and CV and new applications targeted to inter-operate with stra tegic partner products. We use a rapid-prototyping \\nparadigm in the context of the customer engagement to achieve t hese goals. We have made, and expect to continue to \\nmake, substantial investments in research and development. The complexity of our technologies requires expertise in \\nstandards, physical IC design and layout, transistor design and  semiconductor physics, semiconductor process integration, \\nnumerical algorithms, e-beam tech nology, hardware, statistics a nd software development. We believe that our team of \\nengineers will continue to advance our market and technological  leadership. We conduct in-house training for our \\nengineers in certain technical ar eas. Our training also extends  to focusing on ways to enhance customer service skills. \\nAlthough it fluctuates, we can have up to one quarter of our re search and development engineers assigned to one or more \\nprojects, partnered with solutio n services engineers, in a deli berate strategy to provide direct feedback between technology \\ndevelopment and customer needs. We also utilize a variety of sk illed independent contractors for specialized development. \\nCompetition \\nThe semiconductor industry is highly competitive and driven by rapidly changing design and process technologies, \\nevolving standards, short product life cycles, and decreasing p rices. We expect market competition to continue to develop \\nand increase as the market for data and analytics continues to evolve. We believe IC companies benefit from a combination \\nof big data management infrastructure, AI/ML-based analytics en gines, and products that generate and collect \\ndifferentiated data that enrich the analytics process. Currentl y, we are a leading provider o f comprehensive commercial \\nhardware, software and IP solutions for optimizing and improvin g design, manufacturing and test operations processes \\nthrough the application of differentiated data and advanced ana lytics. As a result, we face c ompetition from three primary \\ngroups: internal customer development or design programs, equip ment solutions providers, and providers of analytical and \\ndesign software. We face indir ect competition from internal gro ups at IC companies that offer tools with varying degrees \\nof optimization to accelerate pr ocess-design integration or tes t operations. Some providers of semiconductor \\nmanufacturing software, inspection equipment, electronic design  automation, or design IP may seek to broaden their \\nproduct offerings and compete with us. In addition, companies p roviding general ML and analytics software may focus on \\nsemiconductor companies and comp ete with us. In each of the mar ket segments we compete in, we face competition from \\nestablished and potential competitors, some of whom may have gr eater financial, research, engineering, manufacturing \\nand marketing resources than we have. \\nWe currently face indirect compe tition from the i nternal groups  at IC companies and direct competition from providers \\nof (i) yield management and/or prediction systems, such as KLA Corporation (“KLA”), Siemens AG (“Siemens”), Onto \\nInnovation, Inc. (“Onto”), and Synopsys, Inc. (“Synopsys”); (ii ) semiconductor manufacturing software, such as Applied \\nMaterials, Inc (“Applied Materials”), Synopsys, Invantest, Inc. , Emerson Electric Co., Onto,  and Siemens; (iii) inline \\ninspection, metrology and electrical test equipment providers, such as ASML Holding N.V. (“ASML”), Applied Materials, \\nKLA, and Keysight Technologies, Inc.; and, (iv) connectivity so ftware or integration products/services supporting factory \\nequipment connectivity or control needs of customers, such as P E E R  G r o u p ,  I n c . ,  K o n t r o n  A I S ,  G m b H ,  Y o k o g a w a  \\nElectric Corp., Advantest, and Kornic Automation Co. Ltd. There  may be other providers of competitive commercial \\nsolutions of which we are not aware, and we may compete with th e products or offerings of these named companies or \\nadditional companies if we expa nd our offerings through acquisi tions or development. For example, since our acquisition \\nof Cimetrix in late 2020, we now face competition in the produc ts/services supporting the connectivity, control and \\nintegration of factory equipment. The demand for solutions that  address the need for better integration between the silicon \\ndesign and manufacturing processes may encourage direct competi tors to enter our market. For example, in 2020, two of \\nour competitors were acquired by larger entities, Synopsys acqu ired Qualtera and NI, Inc. acquired Optimal+, and each \\nhas increased marketing or pricing competition with us. For exa mple, in 2023, Emerson Electric Co. acquired NI, Inc. This \\ncompetition in our market may intensify in the future, which co uld lead to increased pricing pressure, negatively impacting \\nour revenues, and slow our ability to grow or execute our strat egy. Also, our current and potential customers may choose \\nto develop their own solutions internally, particularly if we a re slow in deploying our solutions or improving them to meet \\nmarket needs. These and other competitors may be able to operat e  w i t h  a  l o w e r  c o s t  s t r u c t u r e  t h a n  o u r  e n g i n e e r i n g  \\norganization, which would give any such competitor’s products a  competitive advantage over our solutions. \\nWe believe that our solutions compare favorably with respect to  competition because we have demonstrated results \\nand reputation, strong core technology, ability to create innov ative technology, and ability to implement solutions for new \\ntechnology and product generations. See the discussions in “Ris k Factors” under Item 1A for more information about risks \\nassociated with our competition.
